Here is a clean, professional README file in classic style (no emojis, minimal fluff), explaining the project structure, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), the LLM setup, and how Rust components can enhance it. You can copy this directly to your project as `README.md`:

# LLM-Verified with Monte Carlo Tree Search

## Overview

This project combines the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** to provide verifiable, optimized, and adaptive responses across various reasoning tasks. Verification backends such as **Dafny** and **Coq** are integrated to ensure correctness of logic, while containerization and GPU acceleration power its performance at scale.

## Features

* **MCTS-Driven Decision Making**: Efficient exploration and exploitation of possible reasoning paths.
* **LLM-Backed Corpus**: A custom dataset of 6,800+ curated and augmented samples, scraped and preprocessed primarily from healthline.com.
* **Formal Verification**:

  * **Dafny** for automated logic checks.
  * **Coq** for theorem proving and semantic guarantees.
* **Scalable Infrastructure**:

  * Multi-GPU support with NVIDIA A100.
  * Modal Labs sandbox for secure isolated computation.
  * Docker and Singularity for environment consistency.
* **Extensible Backend**: Early-stage Rust components under development to improve performance and memory safety.

## Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

MCTS is a heuristic search algorithm for decision processes, notably used in game theory and reinforcement learning. It consists of four main steps:

1. **Selection**: Traverse the tree from the root to a leaf node using a policy (e.g., Upper Confidence Bound).
2. **Expansion**: Add one or more child nodes to the tree.
3. **Simulation**: Run a rollout (simulation) from the new node to estimate the outcome.
4. **Backpropagation**: Update the value estimates along the traversed path.

We apply MCTS to navigate multiple reasoning paths generated by the LLM, selecting the most promising verified reasoning tree.

## LLM Corpus and Utility

Our LLM is fine-tuned on a robust dataset:

* **Primary Source**: Scraped medical and factual Q\&A from healthline.com.
* **Data Augmentation**: Python-driven generation of paraphrased questions and syntactic diversity.

This LLM is designed to interface smoothly with MCTS logic, providing multiple candidate responses that the tree algorithm evaluates and prunes.

## Infrastructure Setup

### Modal Sandbox Execution

```python
import modal

app = modal.App.lookup('my-sandbox-app', create_if_missing=True)
sb = modal.Sandbox.create(app=app)

p = sb.exec('echo', 'hello world')
print(p.stdout.read())

sb.terminate()
```

### Singularity (Recommended for HPC Systems)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/singularity
cd ~/singularity
singularity pull docker://namin/llm-verified
```

### Docker (Local Development)

```bash
docker pull namin/llm-verified
# run with --docker_sandbox
```

---

## Formal Verification

### Dafny

1. Install from [Microsoft/Dafny GitHub](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny).
2. Ensure Z3 is properly configured in your system `PATH`.

> Run `okdafny.py` to test sample verifications.

### Coq

```bash
opam init
opam install coq
opam install "coq-serapi>=8.10.0+0.7.0"
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-hammer
```

## Rust Integration (In Progress)

Rust is being introduced to:

* **Optimize Memory Handling**: Precise control for data structures used in simulation and backpropagation.
* **Concurrency Enhancements**: Native threads for managing multiple tree simulations.
* **Safety Guarantees**: Rustâ€™s ownership model ensures thread and memory safety, ideal for sandboxed environments.

We plan to offload performance-critical segments like MCTS rollout logic and LLM call batching into Rust modules.

## Status

> ðŸš§ The system is in active development. Do not use in production.

Planned improvements:

* Full integration of Rust backend.
* Multi-agent tree simulation with dynamic corpus evaluation.
* Real-time formal verification feedback in UI.
